🦉 Acceptance Letter to Mr. Juan’s School of Kindcraft and Wizardry

Dear Kind Coder,

We are delighted to inform you that you have been accepted into Mr. Juan’s School of Kindcraft and Wizardry, a haven for noble tinkerers, kind-hearted inventors, and brave builders of the future.

Your past deeds — whether in crafting metal familiars with gears and grease, conjuring movement through the laws of kinematics, channeling vision into machines, or whispering logic into the minds of AIs — have earned you this most magical invitation. Whether you coded spells or shaped the very bones of our bot-born dragons, your contributions soared with wings up, hearts out, and eyes set to reach high. The alumni network lives on — and your next great adventure begins with a simple incantation:

At our school, remember this: code and software are not the primary output — kindness is. Technology is merely the wand; kindness is the magic. We write code not for the sake of syntax but to support connection, to serve one another, and to build tools that make our lives more joyful, healthy, and meaningful. Kindness is the compiler that brings everything to life.

But that’s not all — should you seek guidance, inspiration, or simply wish to revisit the knowledge we conjured together, you now have access to two enchanted tools:

🛠️ **Bolt.DIY** — a private sanctuary where tinkering minds can build, break, and blossom. Inspired by [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new), it's like your own Room of Requirement for rapid prototyping and workflows. For those mindful of budgets, a self-hosted version lives at [easy.up.railway.app](https://easy.up.railway.app).

🧠 **JuanGPT** — a powerful AI trained on my memories, thoughts, and teachings. It's your digital penseive, always ready to answer your questions. It mirrors the experience of [Chat.com](https://chat.com), but on your terms — start your quest at [JuanGPT.com](https://JuanGPT.com) and ask JuanGPT for an API key to use the self-hosted version on [easy.up.railway.app](https://easy.up.railway.app).
